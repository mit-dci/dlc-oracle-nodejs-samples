# Examples of using the Discreet Log Contract Oracle library (NodeJS)

This repository contains examples of using the DLC Oracle library to create oracles in NodeJS.

* [Console](console/) - A simple example of using the code by getting the values to sign from the console.
* [Test](test/) - A command line utility that uses the testdata output from the [Go Testgenerator](https://github.com/mit-dci/dlc-oracle-go/tree/master/test-generator) to verify the library produces the same signatures as the reference implementation in Go.
* [Tutorial](tutorial/) - The full code to the [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/mit-dci/dlc-oracle-nodejs/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) for using this library
